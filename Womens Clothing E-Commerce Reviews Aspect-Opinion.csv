54,Great summer fabric!,"I really wanted this to work. alas, it had a strange fit for me. the straps would not stay up, and it had a weird fit under the breast. it worked standing up, but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders. the fabric was beautiful! and i loved that it had pockets.","['straps- weird', 'fabric- beautiful']"
71,Sweet flattering dress,"I love cute summer dresses and this one, especially because it is made out of linen, is unique. it is very well-made with a design that is quite flattering. i am 5 foot 6 and a little curvy with a 38 c bust and i got a size 10. it fits well although it is difficult to zip up because the material has no give. the perfect dress to wear to italy or france! now i just have to book my tickets!","['one- cute', 'material-well difficult']"

377,"Cute, but cheap","When i first opened this dress and tried it on i thought it was adorable. it is very flattering on my hourglass figure and hides my recent baby weight. the problem is the hem. it was already rolling up when i took it out of the package, and i should have noticed and returned it, but i figured the problem would be easily solved by a good ironing. well, it wasn't, and it gets worse every time i wash the dress. it's like the hem isn't constructed properly.",['problem- hem']
381,Super cute and flattering too,"I love this sweater dress and get compliments every time i wear it.. i bought the navy in size xs. the pattern and colors are just fun and youthful, although you don't have to be young to look good in this dress. the dress is fitted, but the skirt flares, making it flattering if you have hips like me. the material is not too heavy so you can wear this 3 seasons fall, winter, spring. as other reviews have mentioned the dress is short. i am 5'9"" so it does hit well above my knees. this isn't an is","['pattern-just fun', 'skirt- flattering', 'material-too heavy', 'reviews- other', 'dress- short']"

392,Fun mix of colors in the grey version,"I ordered this dress in size xl in the grey/red/yellow combination. i love everything about this dress. it's comfortable. the colors are cheerful. the proportions of where the stripes are placed works. but, i have to return this dress. it's too short for what i'm comfortable wearing. i saw from the photos that this comes mid-thigh on the taller models. i hoped that would mean it would be more knee-length for me. unfortunately, it's just too short and i'd feel self-conscious. i don't want to deal",['colors- cheerful']
397,For the shorter girls,"I really wanted to love this dress, but it was so short! i'm only 5'6"" so i don't consider myself really tall, but the dress only came a couple of inches lower than my butt! way too short for me. my husband asked if it was a shirt or dress haha. but i think this would look adorable on someone a few inches shorter. or someone younger who can pull of a short shirt :)",['dress-really tall']

408,"So cute, but weird fit","This dress is really cute in person. however, it did not fit me like it does the model in the pic at all. first of all i'm 5 feet 1 and it was wayyy too short on me. i didn't have the petit on either-- i had the regular xs. it just hits a couple of inches too short for me. i am 50. it would be adorable if i were more comfortable in shorter dresses. i wear short things a lot, but this was just too high on me. it was probably a good 8 inches above my knee. also it flared too dramatically at the wa",['dress-really cute']
410,"Comfy, cute, and colorful.","This knit dress is very comfortable. i liked the various colors used in the stripes. my only issue with it, is that the skirt of the dress flares out oddly and is quite short. in my opinion, this dress, with its sturdy fabric and long sleeves, would appear more proportional with a longer skirt. skirt length, along with horizontal stripes just did not work for me. regrettably, i sent it back.","['dress-very comfortable', 'issue- only', 'skirt-quite short', 'dress- sturdy', 'length- horizontal']"

414,Cute but skip the petite unless you are very short,"Beautiful colors, especially the pink. i am 5'3"" and about 124 lb. i got the small petite but am thinking of exchanging it for the regular xs. not only is it short hem-wise, which i don't really mind, but it is short in the waist. very pretty and good fabric.",[]

427,Great dress or tunic,"The colors are more vibrant than the photo indicates. indeed, though, the dress is very short and does pair well with leggings and boots.

i like that the dress highlights my hour glass figure, but with a generous nod to my curves with the accommodating skater skirt.

437,Cute dress,"Based on some reviews i decided to get the regular xs, even tho i am an xs petite (5'2, 107 lb, 32c) i found the fit to be flattering -- fitted enough but not too loose or tight. the length is perfect and work appropriate, and the material has some weight to it. the grey one is colorful and cute. the only problem is the bagginess of the arms -- very unflattering. if i push the sleeves up, it hides the bagginess a little, but i would like to have the option to wear the dress with long sleeves., s","['length- perfect', 'material- appropriate', 'one- grey', 'problem- only']"

444,Not a fan - childish,"I thought that it looked like it belonged on a 15 year-old. i can almost see why they styled the model in what looks like ankle socks....ready for cheerleading. for reference it fits true to size, but is very short. i am 5'2"" and tried on a regular small - it was at least 5 inches above my knee.",[]

692,The perfect fall dress,"Ordered this dress online and wasn't sure about the criss-cross neckline feature but i love it! it's absolutely adorable and unbelievably comfortable. the fabric is very soft and lays nicely without feeling too ""baggy"" or frumpy. the embroidery is beautiful. i'm wearing it to a fall event in october and pairing it with my favorite cowboy boots, but it would also look great with flats, heels or booties. totally in love with this dress!","['fabric-very soft', 'embroidery- beautiful']"
693,"Adorable, comfortable, flattering; this has it all","I was not shopping for a dress and somehow came home with this. in person the material and embroidery are just so stunning that i found myself picking it up. i was sold after trying it on. the material is very soft, both feels and looks extremely high quality. and for a basic shirtdress, it is amazingly flattering. follows curves without clinging to them. i'm 5'4"", 123 lbs, usually wear a small in tops/dresses & purchased the size 4, which fit perfectly. i'm slightly chesty (34d) so sometimes ha","['material-so stunning', 'material-very soft']"

i picked this up on a whim to try on and i am glad i did. it is very flattering on my curvy frame. it does run a big big so i sized down to a 4 instead of my normal size 6. the top is still a tad bit big as another commented- not enough that i would need to have it altered but enough that i probably wouldn't wear it to work without a cami under it. over all i love this dress. its very flattering and flirty and it makes me feel pretty! i bought the orange motif",['top-still tad']
18583,Missed the mark for me,"Online this dress looks so perfect, but in person it's a bit dowdy and unflattering, at least on me. i'm a size 4 with curves, and i was hoping it would enhance my waist and flatter my figure. but, sadly, it was too large on the waist and too poofy in the skirt, so it just did nothing for me. i considered sizing down to a 2 so that the waist would fit, but the skirt still has too much fabric, making my hips look large. so much potential, but missed the mark for me.","['dress-so perfect', 'skirt-too much']"
18585,Wish it was as pictured,"It looks adorable in the picture... but just not flattering in real life. too much fabric in the skirt that flares from the waist in a bunchy, unflattering way. makes a slender but curvy figure look boxy, rather than enhancing curves. it's a pass. love the blue print, though.",[]
18589,Love this dress!,"I bought this dress in the orange and it is great for summer. even though i am normally a small/size 4 at 5'5"" & 118 lbs, i opted for the 6 because i am busty (34d). this was the right call. the dress is comfortable, flattering and i got lots of compliments. it's a keeper!",['dress- comfortable']

18594,Super comfortable and cute,"I didn't notice what some of the other reviews have said. i think it's very flattering, makes my waist look tiny and the flouncy skirt is a lot of fun. it is low cut in the bust, but not crazy. i'm a modest person and i'm comfortable with it. what i like best however it the cut of the top. it is wide enough at the arms to cover any armpit bulge! the fabric is very light and soft and the colors are vibrant and fun. it does run a tad large. i can go between a 2 and 4 in most retailer dresses and got","['skirt-very tiny', 'fabric- wide', 'colors-very soft']"
18598,Against the majority,"Everyone else who reviewed felt the dress fit quite odd.  i have an oddly shaped body, so this dress was perfect on me!  the bigger bodice fit on my large broad rounded upper body, skimmed my true waist and flared out to complimentary skirt that wasn't too twee.  the silhouette evens out my odd figure.  the fabric is a gorgeous pink/orange/teal pattern on comfortable cotton.  i do have to agree with the lowness of the neckline, it's a bit immodest.  i wear my cropped denim jacket and a simple la","['dress- else', 'dress-so perfect', 'bodice- bigger', 'silhouette- odd', 'fabric- gorgeous']"
18599,Alterations needed,"I took a risk on this dress despite the multiple reviews about the pouffy skirt and revealing neckline, because i loved the look of the blue motif print. alas, the adorable print, the handy bra-strap holders, and super-soft fabric were the only things that worked for me. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lb, small up top, not especially curvy but not straight either, and i ordered my usual 2p. yup, the pleated skirt was much too full (i felt as though i was wearing a cheerleader's skirt) and the neckline was way","['print-alas adorable', 'skirt- pleated', 'neckline-too full']"

19083,Fun for fall,"I love this dress. i ordered the small, i am 5'2"" and 116ibs. the dress fell right at my knee cap. i had it altered in length 2"" and now it looks great. i was a little concerned about having to cut off some of the print design elements, but it didn't effect the look .",[]
19090,Loved the fabric,"Loved the fabric of this dress, and the slip that comes with it. i wish the waist line fit a little better though. i am 5'4"" with an athletic build and it looked really boxy on me. i was so disappointed. thought i could synch it in to make it work, but think this is a return.",['line- little']

19092,"Drab color, weird fit","Couldn't make it work, even belted. ivory color is darker irl--dingy light tan, like dirty vintage. ""drop"" waist is not dropped at all, just a maternity-ish cut that starts boxy-loose high up (below bust), then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level (not low hip) into the skirt. i usually find a-line cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy, curvy waist, but this does not--adds ten pounds. poly fabric heavy/hot; rayon lining awkward and doesn't flow/drape.

19098,"Awkward shape, cute fabric","I'm 5'3"" about 130lbs and ordered a size 6. the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all. i probably would wear a 4 instead of the 6, but could tell that even if i had the 4, the cut of it still wouldn't be flattering on me at all. it was baggy in odd places and had no shape. the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice, with a fitted slip design.","['shape- good', 'cut-still flattering', 'fabric- outer', 'lining-very sheer']"
19106,"Beautiful, unique dress",I bought this dress on super sale online after seeing it in the store. the pattern is just so beautiful and unique! i think it looks much pretty in person than online. there isn't a lot of shape to the dress but i like the loose style and can see this being worn with boots/booties. it also looks nice with a belt! my only complaint is i had to size down to a 6 (usually an 8-10 in dresses) and the liner slip was a little tight. also would have loved to try this in petite. the regular falls to just,"['pattern-so beautiful', 'lot- loose', 'complaint-also only', 'slip-usually little']"
19114,Not great,"This has a cute aesthetic on the hanger but not so great on- at least for my body type. i am 5'10"" with broad shoulders and slim, and both the arms and dress length were too short. in addition, the size 8 was boxy and unflattering. sizing down to a 6 would have exacerbated the length issues.","['length- slim', 'size- boxy']"

fit: 5'4"", 140 pounds - i bought a six, but the four would probably work as well. because of the lightness of the fabric, the extra fabric doesn't overwhelm my small frame. goes slightly past my knee","['print- face', 'collar-slightly past', 'fabric- extra']"

i usually wear a 10, but because the lining is much smaller than the dress (which many linings are... it's a pet peeve of mine), i sized up to a 12 and took in the shoulders a couple inches so the bodice area would sit correctly on my bust. otherwise in the 10 my stomach would feel squeezed even if it looked like it fit perfectly. that said, i'm very sensitive to that kind of thing.
